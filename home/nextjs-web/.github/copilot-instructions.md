1. We use Bazel for managing our Java dependencies, not Maven, so when talking about Java packages, always give me instructions and code samples that use Bazel.

2. We always write JavaScript with double quotes and tabs for indentation, so when your responses include JavaScript code, please follow those conventions.

3. Our team uses Jira for tracking items of work.
